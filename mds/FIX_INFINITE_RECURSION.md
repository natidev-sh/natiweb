# ‚úÖ Fixed: Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

## ‚ùå Problem

```
infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "teams"
```

**Cause:** Circular policy references
- Teams policy queries `team_members`
- Team_members policy queries `teams`
- This creates infinite recursion loop

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Removed all circular references** by making all policies query `team_members` directly instead of querying back to `teams`.

### **Changed Policies:**

#### **1. Team Members - View Other Members**

**Before (‚ùå Caused Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team members can view other members"
  ON public.team_members FOR SELECT
  USING (
    user_id = auth.uid()
    OR team_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.teams  -- ‚ùå Queries teams!
      WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**After (‚úÖ No Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team members can view other members"
  ON public.team_members FOR SELECT
  USING (
    user_id = auth.uid()
    OR team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM public.team_members  -- ‚úÖ Queries same table
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
    )
  );
```

#### **2. Team Members - Add Members**

**Before (‚ùå Caused Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team owners can add members"
  ON public.team_members FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.teams  -- ‚ùå Queries teams!
      WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**After (‚úÖ No Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team owners can add members"
  ON public.team_members FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.team_members tm  -- ‚úÖ Queries same table
      WHERE tm.team_id = team_members.team_id
        AND tm.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND tm.role IN ('owner', 'admin')
        AND tm.is_active = true
    )
  );
```

#### **3. Team Apps - View Shared Apps**

**Before (‚ùå Caused Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team members can view shared apps"
  ON public.team_apps FOR SELECT
  USING (
    public.is_team_member(team_apps.team_id, auth.uid())
    OR team_apps.team_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.teams  -- ‚ùå Queries teams!
      WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**After (‚úÖ No Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team members can view shared apps"
  ON public.team_apps FOR SELECT
  USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM public.team_members  -- ‚úÖ Direct check
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND is_active = true
    )
  );
```

#### **4. Team Apps - Share Apps**

**Before (‚ùå Caused Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team editors can share apps"
  ON public.team_apps FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.teams  -- ‚ùå Queries teams!
      WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**After (‚úÖ No Recursion):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team editors can share apps"
  ON public.team_apps FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM public.team_members  -- ‚úÖ Direct check
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND is_active = true
        AND role IN ('owner', 'admin', 'editor')
    )
  );
```

## üîÑ Policy Dependency Flow

### **Before (Circular ‚ùå):**
```
teams (SELECT) 
    ‚Üí queries team_members
        ‚Üí queries teams (RECURSION!)
```

### **After (Linear ‚úÖ):**
```
teams (SELECT)
    ‚Üí queries team_members ‚úì

team_members (SELECT/INSERT)
    ‚Üí queries team_members ‚úì (same table, no recursion)

team_apps (SELECT/INSERT)
    ‚Üí queries team_members ‚úì
```

**No circular references = No recursion!**

---

## üöÄ How to Apply

### **Step 1: Run Updated Migration**

Copy the entire updated `teams_workspace.sql` and run in Supabase SQL Editor.

It will:
1. Drop all existing policies
2. Create new policies without recursion
3. Add foreign keys

### **Step 2: Verify**

Test these operations:
- ‚úÖ View teams (should work)
- ‚úÖ View team members (should work)
- ‚úÖ Add team members (should work)
- ‚úÖ Share apps (should work)

### **Step 3: Check for Errors**

```sql
-- If you get any errors, check:
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' AND query LIKE '%teams%';

-- Kill hung queries if needed:
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' AND query LIKE '%infinite%';
```

---

## üí° Why This Works

### **Key Principle:**

**Policies should query "down" or "sideways", never "up"**

```
teams (top level)
  ‚Üì can query
team_members (middle)
  ‚Üì can query
team_apps (bottom)

‚ùå Don't query UP (causes recursion)
‚úÖ Query DOWN or SAME LEVEL
```

### **Our Structure:**

- `teams` policy ‚Üí queries `team_members` ‚úÖ
- `team_members` policy ‚Üí queries `team_members` (same) ‚úÖ
- `team_apps` policy ‚Üí queries `team_members` ‚úÖ

**No upward queries = No recursion!**

---

## üîê Security Still Maintained

**Users can only:**
- ‚úÖ View teams they're members of
- ‚úÖ View members in their teams
- ‚úÖ Add members if they're owner/admin
- ‚úÖ Share apps if they're editor/admin/owner
- ‚úÖ View shared apps in their teams

**Permissions unchanged, just implementation improved!**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Still Getting Recursion?**

1. **Drop ALL policies:**
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view teams they are members of" ON public.teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create teams" ON public.teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team owners can update their teams" ON public.teams;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team members can view other members" ON public.team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team owners can add members" ON public.team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own membership" ON public.team_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team members can view shared apps" ON public.team_apps;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Team editors can share apps" ON public.team_apps;
```

2. **Re-create one by one** (run the CREATE POLICY statements individually)

3. **Test after each one**

### **Check Active Policies:**

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('teams', 'team_members', 'team_apps')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. ‚úÖ `team_members` SELECT policy - No longer queries `teams`
2. ‚úÖ `team_members` INSERT policy - No longer queries `teams`
3. ‚úÖ `team_apps` SELECT policy - No longer queries `teams`
4. ‚úÖ `team_apps` INSERT policy - No longer queries `teams`

### **How:**

- All policies now query `team_members` directly
- Eliminated circular dependencies
- Maintained same security permissions
- No more recursion!

### **Result:**

**Run the migration and everything works!** üéâ

**No more:**
- ‚ùå Infinite recursion errors
- ‚ùå Hung queries
- ‚ùå Timeout issues

**Just:**
- ‚úÖ Fast queries
- ‚úÖ Working teams
- ‚úÖ Proper security
