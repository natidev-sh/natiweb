# Apps

Nati allows you to build powerful AI applications without writing code. Each app is a self-contained unit that can be configured, deployed, and shared with your team.

## What is an App?

An app in Nati is a combination of:
- **AI Model Configuration** - Choose from GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and more
- **Prompts & Instructions** - Define how the AI should behave
- **Integrations** - Connect to external services and APIs
- **Workflows** - Chain multiple AI operations together

> [!NOTE]
> Apps are isolated from each other and can have different configurations and access controls.

## Creating Your First App

Creating an app is simple:

1. Click **"New App"** in the dashboard
2. Choose a template or start from scratch
3. Configure your AI model settings
4. Add your instructions and prompts
5. Test and deploy

```javascript
// Example: Using the Nati SDK to create an app
import { NatiClient } from '@nati/sdk';

const client = new NatiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.NATI_API_KEY
});

const app = await client.apps.create({
  name: 'Customer Support Bot',
  model: 'gpt-4',
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful customer support agent.',
  temperature: 0.7
});
```

## App Types

Nati supports several app types:

### Chat Apps
Interactive conversational interfaces with memory and context.

### Completion Apps
Single-turn text generation for specific tasks.

### Workflow Apps
Multi-step processes that combine multiple AI operations.

> [!WARNING]
> Workflow apps consume more credits as they make multiple AI calls.

## App Settings

Configure your app behavior:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Model | AI model to use | GPT-3.5 |
| Temperature | Response randomness (0-1) | 0.7 |
| Max Tokens | Maximum response length | 2000 |
| Timeout | Request timeout in seconds | 30 |
