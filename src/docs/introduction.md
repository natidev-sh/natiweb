# Introduction to Nati.dev

Welcome to the Nati.dev documentation! This guide will help you understand what Nati.dev is, its core principles, and how you can use it to build powerful AI applications.

## What is Nati.dev?

Nati.dev is a **local-first, free, and open-source AI app builder**. It provides a comprehensive set of React and Tailwind CSS components, along with example flows, designed to accelerate your development process.

### Key Features:

*   **Local-First Development**: Build and run your AI apps entirely on your local machine, reducing cloud dependencies and costs.

*   **Composable UI Blocks**: Leverage a rich library of React + Tailwind components that are fully customizable to fit your brand.
*   **Fast Iteration**: Experience rapid development cycles with instant feedback loops, allowing you to ship features faster.
*   **Great Developer Experience (DX)**: Enjoy typed components, sensible defaults, and clear examples for every block.
*   **Community-Driven**: Contribute to the project, influence its roadmap, and be part of a growing community of AI builders.
